This is an eCommerce payments and products taxonomy project I've been working on lately. It's how I would architect a payments platform from scratch and incorporates features from past projects that involved payment processing. It's still very much a work in progress, but it does currently work with Stripe. The complete project description is here - https://github.com/franky1059/multipayments_app/blob/master/modules/multipayments/README
